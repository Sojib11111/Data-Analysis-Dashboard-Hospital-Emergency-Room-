# PURPOSE OF PROJECT

The purpose of this project is to create a Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Dashboard using Excel to improve efficiency and provide meaningful insights.This dashboard will help stakeholders monitor performance, analyze patient flow, and make better decisions for managing patients and improving service quality.

# KPI’s Requirement

**1. Number of Patients** : 
Count the total number of patients visiting the Emergency Room each day.
Display a daily trend using an area sparkline to identify patterns such as busy days or seasonal trends.

**2. Average Wait Time** :
Calculate the average time patients wait before seeing a medical professional.
Use an area sparkline to track daily changes and highlight days with longer wait times that may require improvement.

**3. Patient Satisfaction Score** :
Measure the average daily patient satisfaction score to assess service quality.
Use an area sparkline to show trends, identify drops in satisfaction, and relate them to possible operational challenges.

# Charts to Create

**1. Patient Admission Status** :
Show the number of patients who were admitted versus those who were not admitted.

**2. Patient Age Distribution** :
Group patients into age categories to analyze age-wise distribution.

**3. Timeliness** :
Measure the percentage of patients who were seen within 30 minutes of arrival.

**4. Gender Analysis** :
Display the number of patients by gender.
